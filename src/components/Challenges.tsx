            Rubber trees love consistency, but Kegalle’s weather is
            unpredictable.
          </p>
          <strong>
            🌧 Rain, Rain… and More Rain! (May–July & September–November)
          </strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Soil washes away = Roots can’t hold on, leading to tree falls.
            </li>
            <li>
              Waterlogged plantations = Roots rot, and diseases like
              Phytophthora leaf fall spread fast!
            </li>
            <li>Muddy fields = Harder tapping, lower latex yield!</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>🔥 Too Much Heat? (January–March Dry Season)</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Rubber leaves dry up faster = Poor photosynthesis = Less latex
              production!
            </li>
            <li>
              Soil moisture evaporates = Trees stress, and tapping becomes less
              effective.
            </li>
            <li>
              High temperatures trigger premature leaf shedding = Latex flow
              weakens.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <strong>💨 Strong Winds & Sudden Storms</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Young trees in Yatiyantota & Deraniyagala are prone to wind
              damage.
            </li>
            <li>
              Branches snap off, delaying growth and reducing latex yield.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <strong>🌡 Unpredictable Temperature Swings!</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Latex flow slows down.</li>
            <li>Tapping efficiency drops.</li>
            <li>Pests attack weak trees.</li>

            Healthy soil = Healthy rubber trees = More latex! But is your soil
            still strong?
          </p>
          <strong>🌱 Soil Erosion is Stealing Your Nutrients!</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Steep lands in Mawanella & Aranayake suffer from topsoil loss
              during monsoons.
            </li>
            <li>Without nutrients, rubber trees struggle to grow.</li>
            <li>
              Exposed roots lead to stunted trees & poor latex production.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <strong>🦠 Soil Diseases Are Spreading!</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Fungal infections thrive in waterlogged soils.</li>
            <li>Poor drainage = Dead trees in just a few seasons!</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>🚜 Soil Compaction: The Unseen Killer</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Overuse of machinery & foot traffic hardens the soil.</li>
            <li>
              Rubber roots can’t breathe or spread = Weak, unhealthy trees.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <strong>⚠ Soil Fertility is Declining!</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Latex yield decreases every year.</li>
            <li>Trees become more vulnerable to diseases & drought.</li>
            <li>Farmers struggle to make profits!</li>
          </ul>
